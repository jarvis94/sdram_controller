# the VHDL standard as the initial values come from the base signal /sdram_con_tb/address_out(12 downto 11).
# ** Warning: (vsim-8684) No drivers exist on out port /sdram_con_tb/uut/address_out(9 downto 0), and its initial value is not used.
# Therefore, simulation behavior may occur that is not in compliance with

# ** Warning: (vsim-8683) Uninitialized out port /sdram_con_tb/uut/data_out(15 downto 0) has no driver.
# This port will contribute value (UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU) to the signal network.
